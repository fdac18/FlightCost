# FlightCost
 Final project analyzing flight data from the Bureau of Transportation to compare average ticket costs across airports in TN.
## To-Do
- Determine *specific* goals for the project (i.e. what all do we want to present at the end of the semester? what kind of results will be most interesting to people?)
- Current thoughts: Compare average ticket costs from BNA, CHA, and TYS airports to every major city in America.
## Data We Can Work With
- [This](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/databases.asp?pn=1&Mode_ID=1&Mode_Desc=Aviation&Subject_ID2=0) provides a list of all 26 databases that the Bureau of Transportation groups together under the umbrella of "Aviation"
- [This](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DatabaseInfo.asp?DB_ID=125) is the "Airline Origin and Destination Survey" database description and [here](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/tables.asp?db_id=125&DB_Name=) are the tables of that database.
